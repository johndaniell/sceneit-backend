# This is a mock backend generated by Ironback

You can run the project using

```
npm run dev
```

> Remember to install the dependencies if you need to with `npm i`

### You're probably gonna have to work only on the db.json file ðŸ˜º

## For Cyclic (or every situation where you cannot write to db.json)

You should replace the [line 7 in your app.js](./app.js#L7)

```
const router = jsonServer.router("db.json");
```

with those 3 lines

```
const fs = require('fs')
const db = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('db.json'))
const router = jsonServer.router(db)
```
